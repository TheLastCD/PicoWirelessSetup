# Pico Wireless Setup
Simple WAP for Raspberry Pi Pico W designed to received Base64 encrypted string via a POST Command and respond by storing the hash in a file called metaConfig.JSON.
The Idea behind this is that you can setup Wifi on a Pico W without having to interface with any code, just issue a curl command.

This is part of a larger Rpi Pico Project i'm working on that is currently Private.

# Future Plan
Re-write in either C or C++ to be me more compact and faster
